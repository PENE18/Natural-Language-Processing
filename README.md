# 📚 NLP (Natural Language Processing) with Python

***


# 📝 Agenda

> 1. Representing text as numerical data
> 2. Reading a text-based dataset into pandas
> 3. Vectorizing our dataset
> 4. Building and evaluating a model
> 5. Comparing models
> 6. Examining a model for further insight

# 📌 Notebook Goals
> In this notebook we will discuss a higher level overview of the basics of Natural Language Processing, which basically consists of combining machine learning techniques with text, and using math and statistics to get that text in a format that the machine learning algorithms can understand!
